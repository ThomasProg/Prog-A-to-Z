However, the machine is, by nature, just a list of bytes and data.

Computers could type their bytes directly on a keyboard.
Typing 0 and 1 is not that fun however.
We quickly decided to replace them by &amp;ldquo;words&amp;rdquo; to make it easier.</description></item><item><title>Where to code</title><link>https://thomasprog.github.io/Prog-A-to-Z/introduction/where-to-code/index.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 17:25:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://thomasprog.github.io/Prog-A-to-Z/introduction/where-to-code/index.html</guid><description>Usually, to code, you need a software to convert the language into assembly for the machine to understand.
However, at first, no need to install anything.
You can just go on https://repl.it/ .
Go there.
At the bottom of the front page, you can select the language you want to use.
Select Python.
You should now see the following page:
