## Lesson

Let's go back in history.\
Industrial revolution was already booming.\
Science was used to create steam locomotive, new types of buildings, etc.\
Items starting to be mass produced.\
All of these things required simple maths computations:
- additions
- substractions
- multiplications
- and others

The problem is, there were a LOT of them, and one error could be fatal.

\
Computers were made to solve that problem.\
People could run operations, and the computer would **print**, display the result, on a terminal.\
\
Today, terminals are not used much.\
We use our mouse to navigate through the desktop, our browser, and our applications instead.\
However, terminals are nice to debug things and to learn how to code.

The reason is, in **every** language, there is a way to display a message easily on a terminal.

\
In python:
```
print("Hello world!")
```

## Exercises

On repl.it, no matter the language, a default code displaying "Hello world!" should be there by default.\
Try displaying "I will be the best!" in Python, C, C++, C#, and Java.
