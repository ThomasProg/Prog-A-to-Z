## Exercises

Imagine being in the XXth century.\
You want to compute 34844 - 343788 / 4 + (284937 + 4389472) * 24.\
However, it is quite bothersome to compute that by hand.\
You decide to use a computer for that.\
You first test the computer by writing the following code:

```python
print(2+5)
print(4*2 + 1)
print(4*(2 + 1))
```

As expected, it returns 7, 9, and then 12.

\
Compute 34844 - 343788 / 4 + (284937 + 4389472) * 24 in Python.

## Rules

On numbers, the following operations exist between numbers: 
+ to add
- to substract
* to multiply
/ to divide

\
Just like in mathematics : 
- Mulitplication and division takes priority
- You can add parentheses to tell which operations should be first

\
These rules work with Python, C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, PHP... and a lot more.
