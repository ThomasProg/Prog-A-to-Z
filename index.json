This is what assembly is.\norg 0x100 mov dx, msg mov ah, 9 int 0x21 mov ah, 0x4c int 0x21 msg db 'Hello, World!', 0x0d, 0x0a, '$' Assembly was better, but still complicated.\nMore than all: it is specific to the instructions of a specific machine.\nRunning the same assembly on a different machine would not work.\nThis is where languages appeared.\nThe goal of languages is to:\nMake code machine independent Make instructions easier to write and understand Debug more easily In short: It makes it easier for the programmer.\nYou should not see the language in itself as an obstacle, as THE thing to learn to become a programmer.\nLanguages are a tool.\nA good programmer is not someone knowing a language well.\nA good programmer is someone good with logic, and that can apply this logic to the code they make.\nDifferent kind of languages exist.\nMainly, they are separated into:\nLow level languages, being closer to the assemby: they let you modify memory easily. High level languages, abstracting a lot of things, to make the code safer for the programmer. Also, languages are abstracting the same thing.\nTheir logic is the same.\nOnce you understand a language, you can understand others easily.\nHigh level languages, like Python, are often recommended to learn how to code.\nThe reason is, they are safe.\nNo random crash happening.\nHowever, they also hide a lot of things, and in my opinion, can make it harder to understand what the code really does.\nThese tutorials will mix languages.\nMainly:\nPython C C++ C# Java If you are here to learn only one language, like Python, don’t worry.\nIt will only makes it easier for you to understand, and not harder.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Languages","uri":"/introduction/languages/index.html"},{"content":" Lesson Let’s go back in history.\nIndustrial revolution was already booming.\nScience was used to create steam locomotive, new types of buildings, etc.\nItems starting to be mass produced.\nAll of these things required simple maths computations:\nadditions substractions multiplications and others The problem is, there were a LOT of them, and one error could be fatal.\nComputers were made to solve that problem.\nPeople could run operations, and the computer would print, display the result, on a terminal.\nToday, terminals are not used much.\nWe use our mouse to navigate through the desktop, our browser, and our applications instead.\nHowever, terminals are nice to debug things and to learn how to code.\nThe reason is, in every language, there is a way to display a message easily on a terminal.\nIn python:\nprint(\"Hello world!\") Exercises On repl.it, no matter the language, a default code displaying “Hello world!” should be there by default.\nTry displaying “I will be the best!” in Python, C, C++, C#, and Java.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Print","uri":"/basics/print/index.html"},{"content":" Prog-A-to-Z Basics The basics you have to know, no matter the language.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Basics","uri":"/basics/index.html"},{"content":" Execution order in Python Programmers use languages to write instructions.\nHowever, these instructions are usually ordered.\nIn python, order is done from up to bottom.\nRun the following code:\nprint(\"Hello\") print(\"world!\") As you can see in the terminal, “Hello” is first printed, and then “world!” is printed.\nExercises 1.

int b = (int) a; // explicit conversion to an integer std::cout \u003c\u003c b \u003c\u003c std::endl; } In that case, the decimal part will be lost and the program will print 5.\nPrinting in C is also complex, because it depends on the type.\\\n#include \u003ccstdio\u003e int main() { int number = 3;

we want to print different things each time we call it.\nWe might want to use a variable.\nWith functions, there are special ways to declare variables, and they are called arguments.\n#include \u003ciostream\u003e void MyFunction(int myVariable) { std::cout \u003c\u003c myVariable \u003c\u003c std::endl;

but in other languages, the type is defined next to the function.\nC++:\n```cpp // here, int is the return type int Foo(): return 3; int main() { int a = Foo() std::cout \u003c\u003c a \u003c\u003c std::endl; } Also, the function ends the moment “return” is called.\\\nint Foo(): int b = 5; return b; // The following code will NEVER execute. b = 3; return b; As you noticed, for the return type, we replaced “void”.\n“void” means there is nothing to return.\nHowever, even in a void function, we can use the return function to put an end to that function.\nExercises (3): Make a function named “AddDigitToRight()”.\nIt takes a number and a digit as arguments.\nInstead of printing the result, it now returns it instead.\nb = AddDigitToRight(484, 1) b = AddDigitToRight(56, 8) print(b) should print:\n568 ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Functions","uri":"/basics/functions/index.html"},{"content":" Lesson As users, we are not making a program.\nFor the program to behave differently, depending on the user, specific functions exist.\nAt first, users only had a terminal.\nMessages were displayed there, and to navigate through it, they entered special words or numbers as inputs.\nReading from a terminal is an easy way to get an input.\nThe same as print(), every language has a way to read the input of the user from a terminal.\nExample:\nmyInput = input() print(\"The input is:\") print(myInput) In python, if the input should be a number, you have to make it explicit:\nmyInput = int(input()) print(\"The input is:\") print(myInput) // C++ #include \u003ciostream\u003e int main() { int myInput;
